This section of this repo is dedicated to verify authenticity of handwritten signatures through image processing and neural networks. 


For using this part it required to run two python files which are:  sigrecog.py and  sigrecogtf.py

 sigrecog.py is dedicated to run with our implementation of a backpropegation neural neywork and sigrecogtf.py is to run with a tensorflow model created using logistic regression
 
 

**Dataset**: 
The dataset used was gotten from the ICDAR 2009 Signature Verification Competition (SigComp2009). More detais are available at ttp://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=ICDAR_2009_Signature_Verification_Competition_(SigComp2009)
